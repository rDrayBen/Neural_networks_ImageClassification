# Neural_networks_ImageClassification

In this notebook we will work on the classification problem, using various CNN models like vanilla CNN, ResNet, InceptionNet. All the experiments will be based on the Simpsons dataset from Kaggle, with the link provided in notebook. This work also includes several experiments, that are using some techniques like parameters tunning, augmentation and others to achieve better results.
